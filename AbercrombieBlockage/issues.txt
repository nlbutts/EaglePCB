Rev 1:
The LED fets are too close to the connector
The C1 and C2 caps are too close to the connectors
The main connectors for the PSoC are still a little two wide
Connect the battery to an AD pin
Pick better pins so the SPI hard peripheral can be used.
The CS for the EEPROM is on the Transmit line of the board
Status LED would be nice
Must short P4.1 to P2.6 for LED1 to work
Move the parts out from under the connector so they can be debugged.

Rev 2:
The LPF is totally wrong. Once again, I rushed it.
But that circuit can be tweaked to be a VBATT monitor, DNP R6, then drive
OPAMP2_OUT to a logic high, jumper C8, put a voltage divider on R5 and C9, read
the analog voltage at OPAMP2+
